# Alkemy challenge --- Getting Started

## I used [cors-anywhare](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
- If you have trouble to fetch the data please request a temporary access to [cors-anywhare](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)


## Log In --- I created a context for this (authContext)
- I first work on the login component
- I make a request to retrive the user token
- I Store the user token on LocalStorage
- The paths will be avalieble only if the user is log In.
- The log out btn removes the token from localStorage

## managing the team --- I created a context for this (heroesContext)
- find
- add 
- remove
- stats
- All this working with its respective message to feedback the user (modal)
